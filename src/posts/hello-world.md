![Hello World!](https://c.tenor.com/mGgWY8RkgYMAAAAC/hello-world.gif)

Yeah my another blog ~~again~~ „Ñü( ‚ñî, ‚ñî )„Ñè

Previously I had a blog that use [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/) and [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/), but now I'm trying to use Static Site Generator (SSG) and what I'm using now is [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev).

I created this blog to make a personal note of what I have learned because sometimes I forget about what I learned in the past, but I am making it open to the public so you can read and learn from it. Because sharing is caring üòá

This blog is created using [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) for the Static Site Generator (SSG), [Netlify](https://netlify.com) to host this site, and [GitHub](https://github.com) to host the source code.

Sorry if there are any mistakes in the articles, you can [contact me](/about/#%F0%9F%93%87-contact) if you have any questions.

Anyway, welcome to my blog and happy reading! ^^
